Hello there,

this is Marwin and I am glad you found your way to this bot.
<br><br>
This is STT Production's first ever Premium Bot!
<br>
It contains a lot of fun and staff/commands.
<br><br>
Now for the basics:
<br>
The Prefix of the bot is "^" . You can use "^help" as your general help command.
<br><br>
You will notice that there is an option called "^help dev"
<br>
These kind of commands are just ment to give me Information about certain things or to help other developers. 
<br><br>
I am putting so much work into this Discod Bot thing now.... I started because I saw a Person creating their own Bot and I was like "Hmm maybe I can do that too!" I started searching up Youtube Videos and and I figured out that coding is/was something I really wanted to learn! I did sit down, followed the first steps of the Tutorial and I had so much fun! My first attempts on creating a bot were really bad. They won't come online or they won't even join the Discord Server. I was so close to giving up because I felt like I just wasnt able to do anything. I was thinking so much about it, until it happened. I had my first bot that actually came online. I felt so good, happy and satisfied at the same time.
The first commands that worked were really weird xD . It would answer with Hello and Hi etc... As more as I googled about it as better I would get at coding. I found out how to use embeds, create and auto moderator, a ban and kick command and so much more. and all of that just because this one Person inspired me to start coding Discord Bots. 
<br><br>
Although its really hard to get people amazed with what I am doing, its definitely what I love to do. I will continue doing this until I get some attention
<br><br><br>
Thank you for using my bot and making me happy as a Discord.js bot developer!! It overwhelms me to see people having fun using my Bots....
<br><br>
Thank you again for using my Bot <3
